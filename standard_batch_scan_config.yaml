# Standard Batch Scan Configuration Template
# This file can be used as a starting point for your custom scans.
# Place this file in the project root to have it detected by the scanner.

# ============================================================================
# GENERAL SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

analysis_mode: multi-timeframe  # 'single-timeframe' or 'multi-timeframe'
timeframe: 15m  # Used for single-timeframe mode
timeframes:  # Used for multi-timeframe mode
  - 15m
  - 1h
  - 4h

cooldown: 2.5  # Seconds between batches (prevents API rate limiting)
limit: 700  # Number of candles per symbol


# ============================================================================
# MARKET COVERAGE (Symbol Selection)
# ============================================================================

max_symbols: null  # Fixed count limit (null = all symbols)
                  # The maximum number of symbols to include in a scan. 
                  # If set to null, all available symbols will be scanned. 
                  # Use this to limit the scan scope for performance or focus.

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 0 SAMPLING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

stage0_sample_percentage: 33  # Sample % (100 = no sampling)
                              # The percentage of the market to select in Stage 0 sampling.
                              # 100 means sample all symbols (no sampling applied).
                              # Reduce this to scan a subset of symbols.

stage0_sampling_strategy: stratified  # Sampling strategy to use
                                      # Available strategies:
                                      # - 'random': Pure random sampling (uniform probability)
                                      # - 'volume_weighted': Higher volume symbols have higher probability
                                      # - 'stratified': Divide into volume tiers, sample evenly from each (RECOMMENDED)
                                      # - 'top_n_hybrid': Top N% by volume + random for rest
                                      # - 'systematic': Every n-th symbol from volume-sorted list
                                      # - 'liquidity_weighted': Combines volume/volatility/spread (advanced)

# Strategy-specific parameters (only used by certain strategies)
stage0_stratified_strata_count: 3  # Number of strata for stratified sampling (default: 3 for top/mid/low)
stage0_hybrid_top_percentage: 50.0  # For top_n_hybrid: % of sample from top volume (default: 50%)



# ============================================================================
# PRE-FILTER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

enable_pre_filter: true
pre_filter_mode: voting  # 'voting' or 'hybrid'
pre_filter_percentage: 30.0  # Top % to select after filtering
pre_filter_auto_skip_threshold: 10  # Auto-skip percentage filter if Stage 3 returns fewer symbols than this

# Fast Mode Configuration
# Fast Mode (fast_mode: true) - RECOMMENDED:
#   Uses 3-stage sequential filtering for optimal performance:
#   - Stage 1: ATC scan only → keeps 100% of symbols that pass
#   - Stage 2: ATC + Range Oscillator + SPC → voting → keeps 100% that pass
#   - Stage 3: ATC + XGBoost + HMM + RF (ML models) → voting → keeps 100% that pass
#   Benefits: Much faster because ML models (XGBoost, HMM, RF) are only calculated
#             for symbols that already passed Stage 1 and 2 filtering.
#   Use case: Large market scans, frequent updates, production environments.
#
# Full Mode (fast_mode: false) - SLOW:
#   Calculates ALL indicators (ATC, Range Osc, SPC, XGBoost, HMM, RF) for ALL symbols
#   from the start, regardless of early filtering results.
#   Benefits: More thorough analysis, all indicators available for every symbol.
#   Use case: Small symbol sets, detailed analysis, research/backtesting.
#
# Note: Even in Fast Mode, Stage 3 still calculates all ML models (ignores fast_mode flag
#       for Stage 3) but only for symbols that passed Stage 2, making it much faster.
fast_mode: true


# ============================================================================
# SPC (SIMPLIFIED PERCENTILE CLUSTERING) CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

spc_config:
  preset: aggressive  # 'conservative', 'balanced', 'aggressive', or null
  
  # Advanced parameters (only used if preset is null)
  volatility_adjustment: false
  use_correlation_weights: false
  time_decay_factor: 1.0
  interpolation_mode: linear
  min_flip_duration: 3
  flip_confidence_threshold: 0.6
  
  # Multi-timeframe SPC alignment
  # Enable multi-timeframe analysis for SPC signals. When enabled, the system
  # will check signal alignment across multiple timeframes to increase confidence.
  # This helps filter out false signals that only appear on a single timeframe.
  enable_mtf: true
  
  # List of timeframes to check for signal alignment. Signals must align across
  # these timeframes (if mtf_require_alignment is true) or show consistency
  # across them. Common combinations: ['1h', '4h'] or ['15m', '1h', '4h']
  mtf_timeframes:
    - 15m
    - 1h
    - 4h
  
  # If true, signals must align across ALL specified timeframes to be considered valid.
  # If false, signals are weighted by alignment percentage (more aligned = higher confidence).
  # Recommended: true for conservative filtering, false for more signal opportunities.
  mtf_require_alignment: true


# ============================================================================
# RANDOM FOREST CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Note: Model status and retrained flag are managed automatically by the system
# and do not need to be configured manually.

rf_training:
  # Force retraining even if model is valid
  # If true, the scanner will force a retrain before starting the scan.
  force_retrain: true
  
  auto_train_if_invalid: true
  training_symbols_mode: 'auto'  # 'auto' or 'manual'
  training_symbols_count: 10  # For auto mode

  training_timeframe: '15m'
  training_limit: 1500


# ============================================================================
# ATC (ADAPTIVE TREND COMPONENT) PERFORMANCE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

atc_performance:
  batch_processing: true  # Rust Rayon multi-threading (recommended)
  use_cuda: true  # GPU acceleration (slower for < 500 symbols)
  parallel_l1: true  # Parallel MA calculations
  parallel_l2: true  # Parallel equity aggregation
  use_cache: true  # Cache intermediate results
  fast_mode: true  # Additional optimizations
  
  # Dask (Out-of-Core) Configuration
  # Use Dask for very large market scans (>1000 symbols)
  # This enables processing dataset larger than RAM by chunking
  use_dask: true  # Auto-enabled by system if symbols > 1000, but can be forced here
  npartitions: null  # Number of Dask partitions (null = auto-calculated)
