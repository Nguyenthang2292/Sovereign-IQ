## Quick Overview

`ExchangeManager` is a system for managing connections to cryptocurrency exchanges through the `ccxt` library. The system is designed with 3 layers:

1. **AuthenticatedExchangeManager**: Manages connections that require credentials (API key/secret)
2. **PublicExchangeManager**: Manages connections that don't require credentials (public data)
3. **ExchangeManager**: Composite manager that combines both managers above
