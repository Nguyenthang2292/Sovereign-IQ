# v1.0.1-LTS: Sovereign IQ

## Summary

Release **v1.0.1-LTS: Sovereign IQ** focuses on stabilizing and standardizing the ATC pipeline, enhancing reliability during batch scans, and updating standard configurations to ensure operational consistency.

## Changes

- **Fix ATC module logic**
  - Stabilized and refined ATC signal processing logic to reduce behavioral discrepancies and increase consistency across different execution modes.

- **Update `modules/adaptive_trend_LTS`**
  - Updated `modules/adaptive_trend_LTS`, including improvements to performance, configurability, and documentation in alignment with LTS standards.
  - Standardized ATC configuration descriptions and organization to streamline operations and backtesting.

- **Update config usage in `main_gemini_chart_batch_scanner.py`**
  - Standardized the batch scanner configuration flow using the `standard_batch_scan_config.yaml` template.
  - Ensured `main_gemini_chart_batch_scanner.py` correctly reads and applies configurations from the new/updated ATC sections.

## Upgrade / Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recommendation:** Synchronize your configuration files with `standard_batch_scan_config.yaml` before initiating a batch scan.

- If you are using custom configurations, compare and merge the ATC sections (specifically those related to **backtesting** and **performance**) to prevent missing keys or unintended behaviors.

## Files touched (high-level)
