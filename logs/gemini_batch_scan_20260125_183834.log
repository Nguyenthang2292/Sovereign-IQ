Pre-filter option:
  Filter symbols using VotingAnalyzer or HybridAnalyzer before Gemini scan
  (Selects all symbols with signals)
[22m[33mEnable pre-filter? (y/n) [y]: [0m

Pre-filter mode:
  1. Voting (Pure voting system - all indicators vote simultaneously)
  2. Hybrid (Sequential filtering: ATC → Range Oscillator → SPC → Decision Matrix)

Pre-filter percentage:
  Percentage of top-scoring symbols to select for Gemini analysis
  Lower = fewer symbols but higher quality (default: 10%)
  Higher = more symbols but may include lower quality signals
  Range: 1-100 (press Enter to use default 10%)

Pre-filter speed mode:
  1. Fast (3-stage filtering - Recommended)
     Stage 1: ATC → Stage 2: Range Osc + SPC → Stage 3: All ML models
     Note: Stage 3 runs ML models for symbols that passed Stage 2
  2. Full (All indicators including ML models - SLOW!)
